## Notes
- **Source**: Topics align with Cisco’s official CCNA 200-301 v1.1 syllabus (2025) from learningnetwork.cisco.com and cisco.com.
- **Engagement**: Use Packet Tracer for labs, gamify with leaderboards, and incorporate breaks. Weekly quizzes (10%) and a final project (20%) keep students active.
- **Profitability**: Price core course at $1,200-$1,500. Add-ons (e.g., subnetting workshop, Python module) at $50-$100 boost revenue. Target 10-15 students per cohort.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on student feedback (e.g., more labs if theory-heavy). Offer optional Week 17 coaching for exam retakes ($100).
